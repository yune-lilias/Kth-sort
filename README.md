# Kth-sort
Sort an "k-close sort" array
Defined the  term: k-close  to  sorted.   For  the  purposes  of  this  problem, we will say that a list of integers is k-close to sorted if every integeris at most k indices away from the index it would be in in a sorted list.Once you know this information, sorting is signi cantly easier than before
Must have a runtime inO(nlog(k)),where n is  the  length  of  the  list  and k is  the  maximum  distancebetween a number's original position and its position in the sorted list
